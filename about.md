Hi there, and welcome to my blog!

I'm Johan Lorenzo. I'm a [Release Engineer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering) at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/). This blog is meant to:

* Share details about what I work on with colleagues and Mozilla's contributors,
* Keep track of pointers of things I learn along the way.

Want to contact me? You can:

* Drop me an email at `jlorenzo+blog at m dot c` (`m.c` stands for mozilla.com),
* Ping jlorenzo [on IRC](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC).
